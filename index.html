  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="intro">
    <p>
      The <strong>Museum of Apartheid</strong> honors South Africa’s journey through the apartheid era — 
      a time marked by injustice, resistance, and courage. Through photographs, personal testimonies, and 
      historical archives, we preserve the voices of those who fought for freedom and equality. 
      This space invites reflection, empathy, and understanding of how the past shapes our collective future.
